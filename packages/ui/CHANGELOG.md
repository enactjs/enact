- `ui/Toggleable` to forward events on `activate` and `deactivate` instead of firing toggled payload. Use `toggle` to handle toggled payload from the event.

## [2.0.0-beta.2] - 2018-05-07

### Fixed

- `ui/Marquee` to always marquee when `marqueeOn` is set to `'render'`

### Changed

- `ui/Cancelable` callback `onCancel` to accept an event with a `stopPropagation` method to prevent upstream instances from handling the event instead of using the return value from the callback to prevent propagation. When a function is passed to `onCancel`, it will now receive an event and a props object instead of only the props object. When a string is passed to `onCancel`, it will now receive an event instead of no arguments. Also when a string is passed, the event will now propagate to upstream instances unless `stopPropagation` is called.

### Fixed

- `ui/Layout.Cell` to no longer overflow when both `size` and `shrink` are set together

### Changed

- `ui/Transition` property `children` to not be required
- `ui/Transition` to fire `onShow` and `onHide` even when there are no `children`

## [2.0.0-alpha.7] - 2018-04-03

### Removed

- `ui/Transition` property `clipHeight`

- `ui/SlotItem` with the properties of `slotBefore` and `slotAfter` so we can easily add things like icons to an item

### Changed

- `ui/Repeater` and `ui/Group` to require a unique key for each object type data
- `ui/Toggleable` to use `'selected'` as its default `prop`, rather than `'active'`, since `'selected'` is by far the most common use case
- `ui/Touchable` to use global gesture configuration with instance override rather than component-level configuration via HOC configs with instance override

## [2.0.0-alpha.3] - 2018-01-18
