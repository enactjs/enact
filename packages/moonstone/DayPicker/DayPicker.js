/**
 * An expandable day of the week selection component, ready to use in Moonstone applications.
 *
 * `DayPicker` may be used to select one or more days of the week. Upon selection, it will display
 * the short names of each day selected or customizable strings when selecting [every
 * day]{@link moonstone/DayPicker.DayPicker.everyDayText}), [every
 * weekday]{@link moonstone/DayPicker.DayPicker.everyWeekdayText}, and [every weekend
 * day]{@link moonstone/DayPicker.DayPicker.everyWeekendText}.
 *
 * By default, `DayPicker` maintains the state of its `selected` property. Supply the
 * `defaultSelected` property to control its initial value. If you wish to directly control updates
 * to the component, supply a value to `selected` at creation time and update it in response to
 * `onChange` events.
 *
 * `DayPicker` is an expandable component and it maintains its open/closed state by default. The
 * initial state can be supplied using `defaultOpen`. In order to directly control the open/closed
 * state, supply a value for `open` at creation time and update its value in response to
 * `onClose`/`OnOpen` events.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * <DayPicker
 *   defaultOpen
 *   defaultSelected={[2, 3]}
 *   onSelect={handleSelect}
 *   title="Select a Day"
 * />
 * ```
