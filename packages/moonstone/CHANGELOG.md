# Change Log

The following is a curated list of changes in the Enact moonstone module, newest changes on the top.

## [unreleased]

### Added

- `marqueeCentered` prop to `moonstone/MarqueeDecorator` and `moonstone/MarqueeText`

### Changed

- The property `checked` is now called `selected` for consistency across the whole framework. This allows better interoperability when switching between various components.  Affects the following: `CheckboxItem`, `RadioItem`, `SelectableItem`, `Switch`, `SwitchItem`, and `ToggleItem`.

### Removed

## [1.0.0-alpha.3] - 2016-11-8

### Added

- `moonstone/BodyText`, `moonstone/DatePicker`, `moonstone/DayPicker`, `moonstone/ExpandableItem`, `moonstone/Image`, and `moonstone/TimePicker` components
- `fullBleed` prop to `moonstone/Panels/Header`. When `true`, the header content is indented and the header lines are removed.
- Application close button to `moonstone/Panels`. Fires `onApplicationClose` when clicked. Can be omitted with the `noCloseButton` prop.
- `marqueeDisabled` prop to `moonstone/Picker`
- `padded` prop to `moonstone/RangePicker`

### Changed

- `data` parameter passed to `component` prop of `VirtualList`.
- `moonstone/Expandable` into a submodule of `moonstone/ExpandableItem`
- `ExpandableList` to properly support selection
- `moonstone/Divider`'s `children` property to be optional
- `moonstone/ToggleItem`'s `inline` version to have a `max-width` of `240px`
- `moonstone/Input` to use `<div>` instead of `<label>` for wrapping components. No change to
	functionality, only markup.

### Removed

- `moonstone/ExpandableCheckboxItemGroup` in favor of `ExpandableList`

## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2016-10-21

This version includes a lot of refactoring from the previous release. Developers need to switch to the new enact-dev command-line tool.

### Added

- Image support to `moonstone/Icon` and `moonstone/IconButton`
- `dismissOnEnter` prop for `moonstone/Input`
- Many more unit tests

### Changed

- Some props for UI state were renamed to have `default` prefix where state was managed by the component. (e.g. `defaultOpen`)

### Fixed

- Many components were fixed, polished, updated and documented
- Inline docs updated to be more consistent and comprehensive
