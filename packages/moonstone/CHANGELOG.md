# Change Log

The following is a curated list of changes in the Enact moonstone module, newest changes on the top.

## [unreleased]

### Added

- `moonstone/ExpandableInput` properties `iconAfter` and `iconBefore` to display icons after and before the input, respectively

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2017-01-30

### Added

- `moonstone/Panels.Panel` property `showChildren` to support deferring rendering the panel body until animation completes
- `moonstone/MarqueeDecorator` property `invalidateProps` that specifies which props cause the marquee distance to be invalidated
- developer-mode warnings to several components to warn when values are out-of-range
- `moonstone/Divider` property `spacing` which adjusts the amount of empty space above and below the `Divider`. `'normal'`, `'small'`, `'medium'`, `'large'`, and `'none'` are available.
- `moonstone/Picker` when `joined` the ability to be incremented and decremented by arrow keys
- `onSpotlightDisappear` event property support for spottable moonstone components
- `moonstone/VideoPlayer` property `titleHideDelay`

### Changed

- `moonstone/Panels.Panels` and variations to defer rendering the children of contained `Panel` instances until animation completes
- `moonstone/ProgressBar` properties `progress` and `backgroundProgress` to accept a number between 0 and 1
- `moonstone/Slider` and `moonstone/IncrementSlider` property `backgroundPercent` to `backgroundProgress` which now accepts a number between 0 and 1
- `moonstone/Slider` to not ignore `value` prop when it is the same as the previous value
- `moonstone/Picker` component's buttons to reverse their operation such that 'up' selects the previous item and 'down' the next
- `moonstone/Picker` and derivatives may now use numeric width, which represents the amount of characters to use for sizing. `width={4}` represents four characters, `2` for two characters, etc. `width` still accepts the size-name strings.
- `moonstone/Divider` to now behave as a simple horizontal line when no text content is provided
- `moonstone/Scrollable` to not display scrollbar controls by default
- `moonstone/DatePicker` and `moonstone/TimePicker` to emit `onChange` event whenever the value is changed, not just when the component is closed

### Removed

- `moonstone/ProgressBar` properties `min` and `max`

### Fixed

- `moonstone/IncrementSlider` so that the knob is spottable via pointer, and 5-way navigation between the knob and the increment/decrement buttons is functional
- `moonstone/Slider` and `moonstone/IncrementSlider` to not fire `onChange` for value changes from props
- `spotlightDisabled` property support for spottable moonstone components

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2016-12-30

### Added

- `moonstone/VideoPlayer` and `moonstone/TooltipDecorator` components and samples
- `moonstone/Panels.Panels` property `onBack` to support `ui/Cancelable`
- `moonstone/VirtualFlexList` Work-In-Progress component to support variably sized rows or columns
- `moonstone/ExpandableItem` properties `autoClose` and `lockBottom`
- `moonstone/ExpandableList` properties `noAutoClose` and `noLockBottom`
- `moonstone/Picker` property `reverse`
- `moonstone/ContextualPopup` property `noAutoDismiss`
- `moonstone/Dialog` property `scrimType`
- `moonstone/Popup` property `spotlightRestrict`

### Changed

- `moonstone/Panels.Routable` to require a `navigate` configuration property indicating the event callback for back or cancel actions
- `moonstone/MarqueeController` focus/blur handling to start and stop synchronized `moonstone/Marquee` components
- `moonstone/ExpandableList` property `autoClose` to `closeOnSelect` to disambiguate it from the added `autoClose` on 5-way up
- `moonstone/ContextualPopupDecorator.ContextualPopupDecorator` component's `onCloseButtonClick` property to `onClose`
- `moonstone/Dialog` component's `onCloseButtonClicked` property to `onClose`
- `moonstone/Spinner` component's `center` and `middle` properties to a single `centered` property
	that applies both horizontal and vertical centering
- `moonstone/Popup.PopupBase` component's `onCloseButtonClicked` property to `onCloseButtonClick`
- `moonstone/Item.ItemOverlay` component's `autoHide` property to remove the `'no'` option. The same
	effect can be achieved by omitting the property or passing `null`.
- `moonstone/VirtualGridList` to be scrolled by page when navigating with a 5-way direction key
- `moonstone/Scroller`, `moonstone/VirtualList`, `moonstone/VirtualGridList`, and `moonstone/Scrollable` to no longer respond to mouse down/move/up events
- all Expandables to include a state arrow UI element
- `moonstone/LabeledItem` to support a `titleIcon` property which positions just after the title text
- `moonstone/Button` to include `moonstone/TooltipDecorator`
- `moonstone/Expandable` to support being managed, radio group-style, by a component wrapped with `RadioControllerDecorator` from `ui/RadioDecorator`
- `moonstone/Picker` to animate `moonstone/Marquee` children when any part of the `moonstone/Picker` is focused
- `moonstone/VirtualList` to mute its container instead of disabling it during scroll events
- `moonstone/VirtualList`, `moonstone/VirtualGridList`, and `moonstone/Scroller` to continue scrolling when holding down the paging controls
- `moonstone/VirtualList` to require a `component` prop and not have a default value
- `moonstone/Picker` to continuously change when a button is held down by adding `ui/Holdable`.

### Fixed

- `moonstone/Popup` and `moonstone/ContextualPopup` 5-way navigation behavior using spotlight.
- Bug where a synchronized marquee whose content fit the available space would prevent restarting of the marquees
- `moonstone/Input` to show an ellipsis on the correct side based on the text directionality of the `value` or `placeholder` content.
- `moonstone/VirtualList` and `moonstone/VirtualGridList` to prevent unwanted scrolling when focused with the pointer
- `moonstone/Picker` to remove fingernail when a the pointer is held down, but the pointer is moved off the `joined` picker.
- `moonstone/LabeledItem` to include marquee on both `title` and `label`, and be synchronized

## [1.0.0-alpha.5] - 2016-12-16

No changes.

## [1.0.0-alpha.4] - 2016-12-2

### Added

- `moonstone/Popup`, `moonstone/ContextualPopupDecorator`, `moonstone/Notification`, `moonstone/Dialog` and `moonstone/ExpandableInput` components
- `ItemOverlay` component to `moonstone/Item` module
- `marqueeCentered` prop to `moonstone/MarqueeDecorator` and `moonstone/MarqueeText`
- `placeholder` prop to `moonstone/Image`
- `moonstone/MarqueeController` component to synchronize multiple `moonstone/Marquee` components
- Non-latin locale support to all existing Moonstone components
- Language-specific font support
- `moonstone/IncrementSlider` now accepts customizable increment and decrement icons, as well as `moonstone/Slider` being more responsive to external styling

### Changed

- `moonstone/Input` component's `iconStart` and `iconEnd` properties to be `iconBefore` and `iconAfter`, respectively, for consistency with `moonstone/Item.ItemOverlay` naming
- `moonstone/Icon` and `moonstone/IconButton` so the `children` property supports both font-based icons and images
- the `checked` property to `selected` for consistency across the whole framework. This allows better interoperability when switching between various components.  Affects the following: `CheckboxItem`, `RadioItem`, `SelectableItem`, `Switch`, `SwitchItem`, and `ToggleItem`. Additionally, these now use `moonstone/Item.ItemOverlay` to position and handle their Icons.
- `moonstone/Slider` and `moonstone/IncrementSlider` to be more performant. No changes were made to
	the public API.
- `moonstone/GridListImageItem` so that a placeholder image displays while loading the image, and the caption and subcaption support marqueeing
- `moonstone/MoonstoneDecorator` to add `FloatingLayerDecorator`
- `moonstone/IncrementSlider` in vertical mode looks and works as expected.

### Removed

- LESS mixins that belong in `@enact/ui`, so that only moonstone-specific mixins are contained in
this module. When authoring components and importing mixins, only the local mixins need to be
imported, as they already import the general mixins.
- the `src` property from `moonstone/Icon` and `moonston/IconButton`. Use the support for URLs in
	the `children` property as noted above.
- the `height` property from `moonstone/IncrementSlider` and `moonstone/Slider`

### Fixed

- Joined picker so that it now has correct animation when using the mouse wheel
- Bug in DatePicker/TimePicker that prevented setting of value earlier than 1969

## [1.0.0-alpha.3] - 2016-11-8

### Added

- `moonstone/BodyText`, `moonstone/DatePicker`, `moonstone/DayPicker`, `moonstone/ExpandableItem`, `moonstone/Image`, and `moonstone/TimePicker` components
- `fullBleed` prop to `moonstone/Panels/Header`. When `true`, the header content is indented and the header lines are removed.
- Application close button to `moonstone/Panels`. Fires `onApplicationClose` when clicked. Can be omitted with the `noCloseButton` prop.
- `marqueeDisabled` prop to `moonstone/Picker`
- `padded` prop to `moonstone/RangePicker`
- `forceDirection` prop to `moonstone/Marquee`. Forces the direction of `moonstone/Marquee`. Useful for when `RTL` content cannot be auto detected.

### Changed

- `data` parameter passed to `component` prop of `VirtualList`.
- `moonstone/Expandable` into a submodule of `moonstone/ExpandableItem`
- `ExpandableList` to properly support selection
- `moonstone/Divider`'s `children` property to be optional
- `moonstone/ToggleItem`'s `inline` version to have a `max-width` of `240px`
- `moonstone/Input` to use `<div>` instead of `<label>` for wrapping components. No change to
	functionality, only markup.

### Removed

- `moonstone/ExpandableCheckboxItemGroup` in favor of `ExpandableList`

## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2016-10-21

This version includes a lot of refactoring from the previous release. Developers need to switch to the new enact-dev command-line tool.

### Added

- New components and HOCs: `moonstone/Scroller`, `moonstone/VirtualList`, `moonstone/VirtualGridList`, `moonstone/Scrollable`, `moonstone/MarqueeText`, `moonstone/Spinner`, `moonstone/ExpandableCheckboxItemGroup`, `moonstone/MarqueeDecorator`
- New options for `ui/Toggleable` HOC
- Marquee support to many components
- Image support to `moonstone/Icon` and `moonstone/IconButton`
- `dismissOnEnter` prop for `moonstone/Input`
- Many more unit tests

### Changed

- Some props for UI state were renamed to have `default` prefix where state was managed by the component. (e.g. `defaultOpen`)

### Fixed

- Many components were fixed, polished, updated and documented
- Inline docs updated to be more consistent and comprehensive
