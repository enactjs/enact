> NOTE: We have also modified most form components to be usable in a controlled (app manages component
> state) or uncontrolled (Enact manages component state) manner. To put a component into a
> controlled state, pass in `value` (or other appropriate state property such as `selected` or
> `open`) at component creation and then respond to events and update the value as needed. To put a
> component into an uncontrolled state, do not set `value` (or equivalent), at creation. From this
> point on, Enact will manage the state and events will be sent when the state is updated. To
> specify an initial value, use the `defaultValue` (or, `defaultSelected, `defaultOpen, etc.)
> property.  See the documentation for individual components for more information.

### Added

- `moonstone/Button` property `icon` to support a built-in icon next to the text content. The Icon supports everything that `moonstone/Icon` supports, as well as a custom icon.
- `moonstone/MoonstoneDecorator` property `textSize` to resize several components to requested CMR sizes. Simply add `textSize="large"` to your `App` and the new sizes will automatically take effect.

- `moonstone/CheckboxItem` style to match the latest designs, with support for the `moonstone/Checkbox` to be on either the left or the right side by using the `iconPosition` property
- `moonstone/VideoPlayer` to supply every event callback-method with an object representing the VideoPlayer's current state, including: `currentTime`, `duration`, `paused`, `proportionLoaded`, and `proportionPlayed`

### Fixed

- `moonstone/Panels.Panel` behavior for remembering focus on unmount and setting focus after render
- `moonstone/VirtualList.VirtualGridList` showing empty items when items are continuously added dynamically
- `moonstone/Picker` to marquee on focus once again

## [1.0.0-alpha.5] - 2016-12-16

No changes.

## [1.0.0-alpha.4] - 2016-12-2

### Added

- `moonstone/Popup`, `moonstone/ContextualPopupDecorator`, `moonstone/Notification`, `moonstone/Dialog` and `moonstone/ExpandableInput` components
- `ItemOverlay` component to `moonstone/Item` module
- `marqueeCentered` prop to `moonstone/MarqueeDecorator` and `moonstone/MarqueeText`
- `placeholder` prop to `moonstone/Image`

- Non-latin locale support to all existing Moonstone components
- Language-specific font support

- `moonstone/Input` component's `iconStart` and `iconEnd` properties to be `iconBefore` and `iconAfter`, respectively, for consistency with `moonstone/Item.ItemOverlay` naming
- `moonstone/Icon` and `moonstone/IconButton` so the `children` property supports both font-based icons and images
- the `checked` property to `selected` for consistency across the whole framework. This allows better interoperability when switching between various components.  Affects the following: `CheckboxItem`, `RadioItem`, `SelectableItem`, `Switch`, `SwitchItem`, and `ToggleItem`. Additionally, these now use `moonstone/Item.ItemOverlay` to position and handle their Icons.
- `moonstone/Slider` and `moonstone/IncrementSlider` to be more performant. No changes were made to
	the public API.
- `moonstone/GridListImageItem` so that a placeholder image displays while loading the image, and the caption and subcaption support marqueeing
- `moonstone/MoonstoneDecorator` to add `FloatingLayerDecorator`
- `moonstone/IncrementSlider` in vertical mode looks and works as expected.

### Removed

- LESS mixins that belong in `@enact/ui`, so that only moonstone-specific mixins are contained in
this module. When authoring components and importing mixins, only the local mixins need to be
imported, as they already import the general mixins.
- the `src` property from `moonstone/Icon` and `moonston/IconButton`. Use the support for URLs in
	the `children` property as noted above.
- the `height` property from `moonstone/IncrementSlider` and `moonstone/Slider`

### Fixed

- Joined picker so that it now has correct animation when using the mouse wheel
- Bug in DatePicker/TimePicker that prevented setting of value earlier than 1969

### Added

- `moonstone/BodyText`, `moonstone/DatePicker`, `moonstone/DayPicker`, `moonstone/ExpandableItem`, `moonstone/Image`, and `moonstone/TimePicker` components
- `fullBleed` prop to `moonstone/Panels/Header`. When `true`, the header content is indented and the header lines are removed.
- Application close button to `moonstone/Panels`. Fires `onApplicationClose` when clicked. Can be omitted with the `noCloseButton` prop.
- `marqueeDisabled` prop to `moonstone/Picker`
- `padded` prop to `moonstone/RangePicker`
- `forceDirection` prop to `moonstone/Marquee`. Forces the direction of `moonstone/Marquee`. Useful for when `RTL` content cannot be auto detected.

### Changed

- `data` parameter passed to `component` prop of `VirtualList`.
- `moonstone/Expandable` into a submodule of `moonstone/ExpandableItem`
- `ExpandableList` to properly support selection
- `moonstone/Divider`'s `children` property to be optional
- `moonstone/ToggleItem`'s `inline` version to have a `max-width` of `240px`

	functionality, only markup.

### Removed

- `moonstone/ExpandableCheckboxItemGroup` in favor of `ExpandableList`

### Fixed

- Inline docs updated to be more consistent and comprehensive
