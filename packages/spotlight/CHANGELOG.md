# Change Log

The following is a curated list of changes in the Enact spotlight module, newest changes on the top.

## [unreleased]

### Added

- `spotlightDefaultClass` to `@enact/spotlight` export. Applying this class to an item in a
	container will cause it to be the default spotted item in that container.

### Changed

- Spotlight containers now default to focus last selected item when gaining focus.
- Removed `decorated` prop from `@enact/spotlight/focusable` as this relationship is managed
	implicitly by the component decorated by `@enact/spotlight/focusable`.

## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2016-10-21

This version includes a lot of refactoring from the previous release. Developers need to switch to the new enact-dev command-line tool.

### Fixed

- Update spotlight container handling
- Inline docs updated to be more consistent and comprehensive

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2016-09-26
