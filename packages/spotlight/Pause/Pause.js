/**
 * Provides a class which allows consumers to safely pause and resume spotlight without resuming
 * another consumer's pause.
 *
 * When multiple components attempt to pause and resume spotlight at overlapping times using
 * [Spotlight.pause()]{@link spotlight.Spotlight.pause} and
 * [Spotlight.resume()]{@link spotlight.Spotlight.resume}, one component might resume spotlight when
 * another expected it to still be paused.
 *
 * `Pause` helps to address this by setting a "soft lock" on the pause which informs other instances
 * that the spotlight pause state is being controlled. When pause is locked, it can only be resumed
 * by the instance that locked it. Subsequent calls to `pause` and `resume` on another instance of
 * `Pause` have no effect.
 *
 * *Note:* The top-level [Spotlight.pause()]{@link spotlight.Spotlight.pause} and
 * [Spotlight.resume()]{@link spotlight.Spotlight.resume} do not respect the pause locks and act as
 * a user-space escape hatch.
 *
 * ```
 * import Pause from '@enact/spotlight/Pause';
 *
 * const paused1 = new Pause('paused 1');
 * const paused2 = new Pause('paused 2');
 *
 * // pauses spotlight
 * paused1.pause();
 *
 * // has no effect because pause1 is in control
 * paused2.pause();
 *
 * // has no effect because pause1 is in control
 * paused2.resume();
 *
 * // resumes spotlight
 * paused1.resume();
 *
 * ```
