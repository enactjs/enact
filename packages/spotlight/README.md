# @enact/spotlight [![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@enact/spotlight.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enact/spotlight)

> An extensible library for 5-way navigation and focus control.

An extensible utility that enables users to navigate
applications using a keyboard or television remote control.  Responding to input
from the **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT**, **RIGHT**, and **RETURN** keys, Spotlight
provides a navigation experience that compares favorably to that of a
computer-with-mouse.

## Usage

```
import kind from '@enact/core/kind';
import React from 'react';
import SpotlightRootDecorator from '@enact/spotlight/SpotlightRootDecorator'
import Spottable from '@enact/spotlight/Spottable'

const MySpottableComponent = Spottable('div');

const MyApp = kind({
	name: 'MyApp',
	render: () => (<MySpottableComponent>Hello, Enact!</MySpottableComponent>)
});
const MySpotlightApp = SpotlightRootDecorator(MyApp);

export default MySpotlightApp;
```

See the [docs](docs/) for more information.

## Additional Information

When using `@enact/moonstone`, the `SpotlightRootDecorator` is applied automatically by
`MoonstoneDecorator`.
