 * used anywhere that a normal Javascript string is used. <p>
 *
 * The options parameter is optional, and may contain any combination
 * of the following properties:<p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>onLoad</i> - a callback function to call when the locale data are
 * fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this object will attempt to
 * load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback.
 * When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the
 * onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this
 * callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two.
 *
 * <li><i>sync</i> - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or
 * asynchronously. If this option is given as "false", then the "onLoad"
 * callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will
 * not be usable for a while.
 *
 * <li><i>loadParams</i> - an object containing parameters to pass to the
 * loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not
 * interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object
 * may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in
 * agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean.

/**
 * Perform the Unicode Normalization Algorithm upon the string and return
 * the resulting new string. The current string is not modified.
 *
 * <h2>Forms</h2>
 *
 * The forms of possible normalizations are defined by the <a
 * href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode Standard
 * Annex (UAX) 15</a>. The form parameter is a string that may have one
 * of the following values:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>nfd - Canonical decomposition. This decomposes characters into
 * their exactly equivalent forms. For example, "&uuml;" would decompose
 * into a "u" followed by the combining diaeresis character.
 * <li>nfc - Canonical decomposition followed by canonical composition.
 * This decomposes and then recomposes character into their shortest
 * exactly equivalent forms by recomposing as many combining characters
 * as possible. For example, "&uuml;" followed by a combining
 * macron character would decompose into a "u" followed by the combining
 * macron characters the combining diaeresis character, and then be recomposed into
 * the u with macron and diaeresis "&#x1E7B;" character. The reason that
 * the "nfc" form decomposes and then recomposes is that combining characters
 * have a specific order under the Unicode Normalization Algorithm, and
 * partly composed characters such as the "&uuml;" followed by combining
 * marks may change the order of the combining marks when decomposed and
 * recomposed.
 * <li>nfkd - Compatibility decomposition. This decomposes characters
 * into compatible forms that may not be exactly equivalent semantically,
 * as well as performing canonical decomposition as well.
 * For example, the "&oelig;" ligature character decomposes to the two
 * characters "oe" because they are compatible even though they are not
 * exactly the same semantically.
 * <li>nfkc - Compatibility decomposition followed by canonical composition.
 * This decomposes characters into compatible forms, then recomposes
 * characters using the canonical composition. That is, it breaks down
 * characters into the compatible forms, and then recombines all combining
 * marks it can with their base characters. For example, the character
 * "&#x01FD;" would be normalized to "a&eacute;" by first decomposing
 * the character into "a" followed by "e" followed by the combining acute accent
 * combining mark, and then recomposed to an "a" followed by the "e"
 * with acute accent.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Operation</h2>
 *
 * Two strings a and b can be said to be canonically equivalent if
 * normalize(a) = normalize(b)
 * under the nfc normalization form. Two strings can be said to be compatible if
 * normalize(a) = normalize(b) under the nfkc normalization form.<p>
 *
 * The canonical normalization is often used to see if strings are
 * equivalent to each other, and thus is useful when implementing parsing
 * algorithms or exact matching algorithms. It can also be used to ensure
 * that any string output produces a predictable sequence of characters.<p>
 *
 * Compatibility normalization
 * does not always preserve the semantic meaning of all the characters,
 * although this is sometimes the behaviour that you are after. It is useful,
 * for example, when doing searches of user-input against text in documents
 * where the matches are supposed to "fuzzy". In this case, both the query
 * string and the document string would be mapped to their compatibility
 * normalized forms, and then compared.<p>
 *
 * Compatibility normalization also does not guarantee round-trip conversion
 * to and from legacy character sets as the normalization is "lossy". It is
 * akin to doing a lower- or upper-case conversion on text -- after casing,
 * you cannot tell what case each character is in the original string. It is
 * good for matching and searching, but it rarely good for output because some
 * distinctions or meanings in the original text have been lost.<p>
 *
 * Note that W3C normalization for HTML also escapes and unescapes
 * HTML character entities such as "&amp;uuml;" for u with diaeresis. This
 * method does not do such escaping or unescaping. If normalization is required
 * for HTML strings with entities, unescaping should be performed on the string
 * prior to calling this method.<p>
 *
 * <h2>Data</h2>
 *
 * Normalization requires a fair amount of mapping data, much of which you may
 * not need for the characters expected in your texts. It is possible to assemble
 * a copy of ilib that saves space by only including normalization data for
 * those scripts that you expect to encounter in your data.<p>
 *
 * The normalization data is organized by normalization form and within there
 * by script. To include the normalization data for a particular script with
 * a particular normalization form, use the directive:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * !depends &lt;form&gt;/&lt;script&gt;.js
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * Where &lt;form&gt is the normalization form ("nfd", "nfc", "nfkd", or "nfkc"), and
 * &lt;script&gt; is the ISO 15924 code for the script you would like to
 * support. Example: to load in the NFC data for Cyrillic, you would use:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * !depends nfc/Cyrl.js
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * Note that because certain normalization forms include others in their algorithm,
 * their data also depends on the data for the other forms. For example, if you
 * include the "nfc" data for a script, you will automatically get the "nfd" data
 * for that same script as well because the NFC algorithm does NFD normalization
 * first. Here are the dependencies:<p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>NFD -> no dependencies
 * <li>NFC -> NFD
 * <li>NFKD -> NFD
 * <li>NFKC -> NFKD, NFD, NFC
 * </ul>
 *
 * A special value for the script dependency is "all" which will cause the data for
 * all scripts
 * to be loaded for that normalization form. This would be useful if you know that
 * you are going to normalize a lot of multilingual text or cannot predict which scripts
 * will appear in the input. Because the NFKC form depends on all others, you can
 * get all of the data for all forms automatically by depending on "nfkc/all.js".
 * Note that the normalization data for practically all script automatically depend
 * on data for the Common script (code "Zyyy") which contains all of the characters
 * that are commonly used in many different scripts. Examples of characters in the
 * Common script are the ASCII punctuation characters, or the ASCII Arabic
 * numerals "0" through "9".<p>
 *
 * By default, none of the data for normalization is automatically
 * included in the preassembled iliball.js file.
 * If you would like to normalize strings, you must assemble
 * your own copy of ilib and explicitly include the normalization data
 * for those scripts as per the instructions above. This normalization method will
 * produce output, even without the normalization data. However, the output will be
 * simply the same thing as its input for all scripts
 * except Korean Hangul and Jamo, which are decomposed and recomposed
 * algorithmically and therefore do not rely on data.<p>
 *
 * If characters are encountered for which there are no normalization data, they
 * will be passed through to the output string unmodified.
 *
 * @param {string} form The normalization form requested
 * @return {IString} a new instance of an IString that has been normalized
 * according to the requested form. The current instance is not modified.

 * combining characters are returned as a single unit.<p>
 *
 * The standard Javascript String's charAt() method only
 * returns information about a particular 16-bit character in the
 * UTF-16 encoding scheme.
 * If the index is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character,
 * it will return that surrogate character rather
 * than the surrogate pair which represents a character
 * in the supplementary planes.<p>
 *
 * The iterator instance returned has two methods, hasNext() which
 * returns true if the iterator has more characters to iterate through,
 * and next() which returns the next character.<p>
 *
 * @return {Object} an iterator
 * that iterates through all the characters in the string
