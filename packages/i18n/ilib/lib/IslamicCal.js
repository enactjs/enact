 * @class
 * Construct a new Islamic calendar object. This class encodes information about

 * calendar where the dates are calculated by arithmetic rules. This differs from 
 * the religious Islamic calendar which is used to mark the beginning of particular 
 * holidays. The religious calendar depends on the first sighting of the new 
 * crescent moon to determine the first day of the new month. Because humans and 
 * weather are both involved, the actual time of sighting varies, so it is not 
 * really possible to precalculate the religious calendar. Certain groups, such 
 * as the Islamic Society of North America, decreed in in 2007 that they will use
 * a calendar based on calculations rather than observations to determine the 
 * beginning of lunar months, and therefore the dates of holidays.<p>
