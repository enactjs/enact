/**
 * @class
 * Create a new currency information instance. Instances of this class encode 
 * information about a particular currency.<p>
 * 
 * Note: that if you are looking to format currency for display, please see
 * the number formatting class {NumFmt}. This class only gives information
 * about currencies.<p> 
 * 
 * The options can contain any of the following properties:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>locale</i> - specify the locale for this instance
 * <li><i>code</i> - find info on a specific currency with the given ISO 4217 code 
 * <li><i>sign</i> - search for a currency that uses this sign
 * <li><i>onLoad</i> - a callback function to call when the currency data is fully 
 * loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to
 * load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback.
 * When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the 
 * onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this
 * callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. 
 * <li><i>sync</i> - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or 
 * asynchronously. If this option is given as "false", then the "onLoad"
 * callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will
 * not be usable for a while.
 * <li><i>loadParams</i> - an object containing parameters to pass to the 
 * loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not
 * interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object 
 * may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in
 * agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * When searching for a currency by its sign, this class cannot guarantee 
 * that it will return info about a specific currency. The reason is that currency 
 * signs are sometimes shared between different currencies and the sign is 
 * therefore ambiguous. If you need a 
 * guarantee, find the currency using the code instead.<p>
 * 
 * The way this class finds a currency by sign is the following. If the sign is 
 * unambiguous, then
 * the currency is returned. If there are multiple currencies that use the same
 * sign, and the current locale uses that sign, then the default currency for
 * the current locale is returned. If there are multiple, but the current locale
 * does not use that sign, then the currency with the largest circulation is
 * returned. For example, if you are in the en-GB locale, and the sign is "$",
 * then this class will notice that there are multiple currencies with that
 * sign (USD, CAD, AUD, HKD, MXP, etc.) Since "$" is not used in en-GB, it will 
 * pick the one with the largest circulation, which in this case is the US Dollar
 * (USD).<p>
 * 
 * If neither the code or sign property is set, the currency that is most common 
 * for the locale
 * will be used instead. If the locale is not set, the default locale will be used.
 * If the code is given, but it is not found in the list of known currencies, this
 * constructor will throw an exception. If the sign is given, but it is not found,
 * this constructor will default to the currency for the current locale. If both
 * the code and sign properties are given, then the sign property will be ignored
 * and only the code property used. If the locale is given, but it is not a known
 * locale, this class will default to the default locale instead.<p>
 * 
 * 
 * @constructor
 * @param options {Object} a set of properties to govern how this instance is constructed.
 * @throws "currency xxx is unknown" when the given currency code is not in the list of 
 * known currencies. xxx is replaced with the requested code.
