/**
 * Factory method to create a new instance of a date subclass.<p>
 * 
 * The options parameter can be an object that contains the following
 * properties:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>type</i> - specify the type/calendar of the date desired. The
 * list of valid values changes depending on which calendars are 
 * defined. When assembling your iliball.js, include those date type 
 * you wish to use in your program or web page, and they will register 
 * themselves with this factory method. The "gregorian",
 * and "julian" calendars are all included by default, as they are the
 * standard calendars for much of the world. If not specified, the type
 * of the date returned is the one that is appropriate for the locale.
 * This property may also be given as "calendar" instead of "type".
 * 
 * <li><i>onLoad</i> - a callback function to call when the date object is fully 
 * loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the date factory will attempt to
 * load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback.
 * When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the 
 * onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this
 * callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two.
 * 
 * <li><i>sync</i> - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or 
 * asynchronously. If this option is given as "false", then the "onLoad"
 * callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will
 * not be usable for a while.
 *  
 * <li><i>loadParams</i> - an object containing parameters to pass to the 
 * loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not
 * interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object 
 * may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in
 * agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The options object is also passed down to the date constructor, and 
 * thus can contain the the properties as the date object being instantiated.
 * See the documentation for {@link GregorianDate}, and other
 * subclasses for more details on other parameter that may be passed in.<p>
 * 
 * Please note that if you do not give the type parameter, this factory
 * method will create a date object that is appropriate for the calendar
 * that is most commonly used in the specified or current ilib locale. 
 * For example, in Thailand, the most common calendar is the Thai solar 
 * calendar. If the current locale is "th-TH" (Thai for Thailand) and you 
 * use this factory method to construct a new date without specifying the
 * type, it will automatically give you back an instance of 
 * {@link ThaiSolarDate}. This is convenient because you do not 
 * need to know which locales use which types of dates. In fact, you 
 * should always use this factory method to make new date instances unless
 * you know that you specifically need a date in a particular calendar.<p>
 * 
 * Also note that when you pass in the date components such as year, month,
 * day, etc., these components should be appropriate for the given date
 * being instantiated. That is, in our Thai example in the previous
 * paragraph, the year and such should be given as a Thai solar year, not
 * the Gregorian year that you get from the Javascript Date class. In
 * order to initialize a date instance when you don't know what subclass
 * will be instantiated for the locale, use a parameter such as "unixtime" 
 * or "julianday" which are unambiguous and based on UTC time, instead of
 * the year/month/date date components. The date components for that UTC 
 * time will be calculated and the time zone offset will be automatically 
 * factored in.
 * 
 * @static
 * @param {Object=} options options controlling the construction of this instance, or
 * undefined to use the default options
 * @return {IDate} an instance of a calendar object of the appropriate type
