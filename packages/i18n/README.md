> Internationalization library based on iLib.

`@enact/i18n` provides a decorator that can be used to wrap a root component in a React (or Enact) application.
This decorator provides a context to child components that can be used to determine locale text directionality
and to update the current locale.

## Usage

```
import {I18nContextDecorator, I18nDecorator} from '@enact/i18n/I18nDecorator';
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = I18nContextDecorator(
    {rtlProp: 'rtl'},
    (props) => (
        <div>{props.rtl ? 'right to left' : 'left to right'}</div>
    )
);

const MyApp = () => (
    <div>
        <MyComponent />
    </div>
);

const MyI18nApp = I18nDecorator(MyApp);
```

## Install

```
npm install --save @enact/i18n
```
