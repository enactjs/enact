# @enact/i18n [![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@enact/i18n.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enact/i18n)

> Internationalization library based on iLib.

`@enact/i18n` provides a decorator that can be used to wrap a root component in a React (or Enact) application.
This decorator provides a context to child components that can be used to determine locale text directionality
and to update the current locale. Additionally, it provides a locale-aware `Uppercase` Higher Order Component (HOC).

## Usage

```
import {I18nDecorator, contextTypes} from `@enact/i18n/I18nDecorator`;

const MyComponent = (props, context) => (
    <div>{context.rtl ? "right to left" : "left to right"}</div>
);

// Without contextTypes, your component will not receive context!
MyComponent.contextTypes = contextTypes;

const MyApp = () => (
    <div>
        <MyComponent />
    </div>
);

const MyI18nApp = I18nDecorator(MyApp);
```

`Uppercase` may be used independently of the app decorator. By default, it uppercases the `children` property of
the wrapped component, provided it is a `string`.

```
import Uppercase from `@enact/i18n/Uppercase`

const MyComponent = (props) => (
    <div {...props} />
);

const MyUppercaseComponent = Uppercase(MyComponent);
```
Passing `preserveCase` in the props to `MyUppercaseComponent` will prevent uppercasing.

## Install

```
npm install --save @enact/i18n
```
