# Change Log

The following is a curated list of changes in the Enact project, newest changes on the top.

## [unreleased]

### Changed

- `moonstone/Divider`'s `children` property is now optional


## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2016-10-21

This version includes a lot of refactoring from the previous release. Developers need to switch to the new enact-dev command-line tool.

### Added

- New components and HOCs: `moonstone/Scroller`, `moonstone/VirtualList`, `moonstone/VirtualGridList`, `moonstone/Scrollable`, `moonstone/MarqueeText`, `moonstone/Spinner`, `moonstone/ExpandableCheckboxItemGroup`, `moonstone/MarqueeDecorator`, `ui/Cancelable`, `ui/Changeable`, `ui/Selectable`
- Support for enact-dev command-line tool.
- `fetch()` polyfill to support pre-rendering
- New options for `ui/Toggleable` HOC
- Ability to adjust locale in Sampler
- Marquee support to many components
- Image support to `moonstone/Icon` and `moonstone/IconButton`
- QA Sampler with test-specific samples (not to be used as examples of good coding style!)
- Looser app-specific ESLint rules
- webOS utility functions
- `dismissOnEnter` prop for `moonstone/Input`
- Many more unit tests

### Changed

- Sampler now uses port 8080
- Removed `ui/Pickable` HOC
- Some props for UI state were renamed to have `default` prefix where state was managed by the component. (e.g. `defaultOpen`)
- Removed Babel polyfill to support future snapshot work. This may affect apps that relied on specific polyfills. Added the following specific polyfills: `window.fetch` (plus associated Fetch APIs), `window.Promise`, `Math.sign`, `Object.assign`, `String.fromCodePoint`, `String.prototype.codePointAt`
- Computed properties in `kind()` no longer mutate props. In other words, changing the value of a prop in one computed property does not affect the value of that prop in another computed property.

### Fixed

- Many components were fixed, polished, updated and documented
- Inline docs updated to be more consistent and comprehensive

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2016-09-26
